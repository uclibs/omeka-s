# FileSideload

This module provides functionality to "sideload" files (ingesting files that are already on the server). It will allow users to batch-add many files at once to their repository, rather than uploading the files individually. It also will enable users to circumvent server file size restrictions that limit the capacity of web-form upload.
Files can be selected individually or as a set at the directory level, for example all images of a scanned manuscript.

See the [Omeka S user manual](http://omeka.org/s/docs/user-manual/modules/filesideload/) for user documentation.
