# Persistent Identifiers

Create/import & assign persistent identifiers (PIDs) to Omeka S items. PIDs can be assigned at either item creation or through later batch edit, and will resolve to a stable, non-site-specific page for each item.

The PID module is designed in a flexible way to better connect with various PID service APIs for PID creation or import. The module can currently connect to the following PID APIs (i.e. all other PID services will require additional code):

- [ARKs](https://arks.org) via [EZID](https://ezid.cdlib.org)
- [DOIs](https://www.doi.org) via [DataCite](https://datacite.org)

See the [Omeka S user manual](http://omeka.org/s/docs/user-manual/modules/persistentidentifiers/) for user documentation.
