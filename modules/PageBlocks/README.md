# Page Blocks: Omeka S module

This module adds additional modular, customizable page elements. It was built to be used in conjunction with [Multilingual](https://github.com/ivyrze/omeka-s-theme-multilingual), but you can, with varying levels of success, use it alongside other themes.

The currently available page blocks are:

* Jumbotron search
* Image banner
* Call to action
* Team members
* List of topics
* Accordion group
* Media + single column
* Two column HTML
* Three column HTML

There are also resource page blocks available:

* Smart embeds
