[Advanced Resource Template] is a module for [Omeka S] that adds new settings to
the resource templates in order to simplify and to improve the edition of
resources:

- Require a resource class from a limited list of resource classes:

  ![Require a resource class from a limited list of resource classes](data/images/required_limited_class.png))

- Limit template to a closed list of properties:

  ![Limit template to defined properties](data/images/closed_template.png)

- Minimum/maximum length of a literal value

- Minimum/maximum number of values:

  It allows to force to have only one value when needed, for example a main
  category or a publication date, or to limit the values to a specific number.

- Default value:

  This option simplifies creation of resources manually.

- Automatic value (on save):

  This option allows to add a value to the resource. By construction, this value
  cannot be removed.

- Locked values:

  This option is useful for identifiers. Note that an automatic value is always
  a locked value, so this option is designed  for other values. A locked value
  can still be updated by the api.

- Explode a value with a separator:

  This option allows to let the user filling multiple values in one field, then
  the values are exploded on save. For example, the property "dcterms:subject"
  can use the ";" as separator, so when the user fills "alpha; beta", it will be
  exploded into two values "alpha" and "beta".

- Filter resources with a query:

  For properties filled with an internal resource, the right sidebar searches in
  all resources by default. The option allows to limit them with a query to find
  them quickly. The query is the arguments of an standard advanced search request.

- Auto-completion with existing values:

  ![Example of autocompletion](data/images/autocompletion.png)

- Other parameters:

  An option is added to add new parameters to the property. It does nothing by
  default, but can be used to pass informations about template properties to
  complex themes. There is no format for the parameters for now, since they
  should be managed by the theme or a specific module. It is recommended to use
  keys values pairs separated by "=" or json.

- Multiple fields with the same property:

  This option allows to have multiple times the same property with different
  settings. For example, you may want to have a free subject and a subject from
  two thesaurus. They can be set as different data types of the same property,
  but as multple template properties too, so each one has its own label and
  settings (size, number, etc.), as for spatial cover ("couverture spatiale") in
  the example below.
  **Warning**: for compatibility with core and modules and because they are
  variants of the same property, the template properties are kept gathered
  according to the original term in the resource template. So, in the example
  below, it is not possible to include another template property between the two
  spatial covers.

  ![Example of multiple subjects with different settings](data/images/duplicate_properties.png)

- Group properties under a label:

  When values and properties are numerous, the module allows to group them under
  a label. For example, you can group the Dublin Core properties like that:

  ```
  # Descriptive metadata
  dcterms:title
  dcterms:description
  dcterms:type
  dcterms:source
  dcterms:relation

  # Indexing metadata
  dcterms:coverage
  dcterms:subject

  # Intellectual property metadata
  dcterms:creator
  dcterms:contributor
  dcterms:publisher
  dcterms:rights

  # Instantiation metadata
  dcterms:date
  dcterms:format
  dcterms:identifier
  dcterms:language
  ```

  Here, the record is divided under four group labels.
  When some properties have multiple fields, you can group them more precisely
  appending the property label after a `/`, for example : `dcterms:subject/Sujets Rameau`
  and `dcterms:subject/Sujets libres`.

  ![Example of display of grouped properties](data/images/groups_properties.png)

- Language selection and default by template and by property, or no language:

  ![Example of language by template and property](data/images/advanced_language_settings.png)

- Creation of a new linked resource during edition of a resource:

  This is useful to create a new author of a resource when authors are managed
  as resources. An option allows to allow it or to forbid it for each property.
  After creation, the new resource is automatically linked to the resource being
  edited.

  ![Creation of a new resource via a pop-up](data/images/new_resource_during_edition.png)

- Selection of default data types:

  ![Selection of default data types](data/images/default_datatypes.png)

- Autofill multiple fields with external data ([IdRef], and [Geonames] and generic
  json or xml services):

  See below.

- Import and export of templates as spreadsheet (csv/tsv):

Installation
------------

See general end user documentation for [installing a module].

The optional module [Generic] may be installed first.

The module uses an external library, so use the release zip to install it, or
use and init the source.

* From the zip

Download the last release [AdvancedResourceTemplate.zip] from the list of releases
(the master does not contain the dependency), and uncompress it in the `modules`
directory.

* From the source and for development

If the module was installed from the source, rename the name of the folder of
the module to `AdvancedResourceTemplate`, go to the root module, and run:

```sh
composer install --no-dev
```


Usage
-----

Simply update your resource templates with the new options and use them in the
resource forms.

Here are some details for some features.

### Default value

By default, simply set the string to use a default value. For a resource, this
is the resource id and for uri this is the uri.

For a uri with a label, just separate the uri and the label with a space:
```
https://example.com/my-id Label of the value
```

For other data types that may be more complex, the default value can be set as a
json with all hidden sub-data that are in the Omeka resource form.

For a uri with a label and a language (for value suggest):
```json
{
    "@id": "https://example.com/my-id",
    "o:label": "Label of the value",
    "@value": "Value of the value (let empty)",
    "@language": "eng"
}
```

For a linked resource, that is useful only for a better display:
```json
{
    "display_title": "Title of my object",
    "value_resource_id": "1",
    "value_resource_name": "items",
    "url": "/admin/item/1",
}
```

### Automatic value

This option can be set at template level or template property level. The aim is
the same, but when created, the property level display the input in the form.

#### Property level

The value specified in the field will be appended to the resource.

The value may be a simple string or a json representation of a value (like in
the api). The type of the value should be one specified in the data types of the
template property. A check is done for validity, for example the id should
exists when the data type is a resource.

Some basic placeholders can be used with json dot notation and basic twig-like
commands. The format is the same than the auto-filling (see below). A future
release will integrate the improvements made for the module [Bulk Import].

#### Template level

Unlike property level, multiple values can be set, one by line.

For templates, the property should be specified too, and eventually other data
(language, visibility).

For example, to define the template and an automatic identifier for a media when
saving an item:

```
~ = o:resource_template = 1
~ = dcterms:identifier ^^literal {o:item.dcterms:creator.0..@value}_{o:item.o:template.o:label}_{{ index() }}
```

### Autofilling

For the autofilling, you have to set the mappings inside the main settings, then
to select it inside the resource template.

The mapping is a simple text specifying the services and the mappings. it uses
a similar format than the modules [Bulk Export], [Bulk Import], and [Bulk Import Files].
It will be improved with the [Bulk Import] format in a future release.

#### Integrated services

For example, if the service returns an xml Marc like for [Colbert], the mapping
can be a list of XPath and properties with some arguments (here with the
specialized ontology [bio] to manage biographic metadata):

```
[idref:person] = IdRef Person
/record/controlfield[@tag="003"] = bibo:uri ^^uri
/record/datafield[@tag="900"]/subfield[@code="a"] = dcterms:title
/record/datafield[@tag="200"]/subfield[@code="a"] = foaf:familyName
/record/datafield[@tag="200"]/subfield[@code="b"] = foaf:firstName
/record/datafield[@tag="200"]/subfield[@code="f"] = dcterms:date
/record/datafield[@tag="103"]/subfield[@code="a"] = bio:birth ^^numeric:timestamp ~ {{ value|dateIso }}
/record/datafield[@tag="103"]/subfield[@code="b"] = bio:death ^^numeric:timestamp ~ {{ value|dateIso }}
/record/datafield[@tag="340"]/subfield[@code="a"] = bio:olb @fra
/record/datafield[@tag="200"]/subfield[@code="c"] = bio:position @fra
```

The first line contains the key and the label of the mapping, that will be
listed in the resource template form. Multiple mapping can be appended for
different services.

You can use the same autofiller with multiple mappings for different purposes:
append a number to the key (`[idref:person #2]`). If the mapping isn’t available,
it will be skipped. Don’t change it once defined, else you will have to check
all resource templates that use it.

For a json service, use the object notation:

```
[geonames]
?username=demo
toponymName = dcterms:title
geonameId = dcterms:identifier ^^uri ~ https://www.geonames.org/{__value__}
adminCodes1.ISO3166_2 = dcterms:identifier ~ ISO 3166-2: {__value__}
countryName = dcterms:isPartOf
~ = dcterms:spatial ~ Coordonnées : {lat}/{lng}
```

Note that [geonames] requires a user name (that should be the one of your
institution, but it can be "demo", "google", or "johnsmith"). Test it on
https://api.geonames.org/searchJSON?username=demo.

If the key contains a `.` or a `\`, it should be escaped with a `\`: `\.` and `\\`.

More largely, you can append any arguments to the query sent to the remote
service: simply append them url encoded on a line beginning with `?`.

It’s also possible to format the values: simply append `~` to indicate the
pattern to use and `{__value__}` to set the value from the source. For a complex
pattern, you can use any source path between `{` and `}`.

For more complex pattern, you can use some [Twig filters] with the current
value. For example, to convert a date `17890804` into a standard [ISO 8601]
numeric date time `1789-08-04`, you can use:
```
/record/datafield[@tag="103"]/subfield[@code="b"] = dcterms:valid ^^numeric:timestamp ~ {{ value|trim|slice(1,4) }}-{{ value|trim|slice(5,2) }}-{{ value|trim|slice(7,2) }}
```

The Twig filter starts with two `{` and a space and finishes with a space and
two `}`. it works only with the current `value`.


#### Other services

If you want to include a service that is not supported currently, you can choose
the autofiller `generic:json` or `generic:xml`. Two required and two optional
params should be added on four separate lines:
- the full url of the service,
  Note that the protocol may need to be `http`, not `https` on some servers (the
  server where Omeka is installed), because the request is done by Omeka itself,
  not by the browser. So, to use the recommended `https`, you may have to [config the keys]
  `sslcapath` and `sslcafile` in the Omeka file `config/local.config.php`.
- the query with the placeholder `{query}`, starting with a `?`,
- the path to the list of results, when it is not root, in order to loop them,
  indicated with `{list}`,
- the path to the value to use as a label for each result, indicated with
  `{__label__}`. If absent, the first field will be used.

For exemple, you can query another Omeka S service (try with "archives"), or the
services above:

```
[generic:json #Mall History] Omeka S demo Mall History
http://dev.omeka.org/omeka-s-sandbox/api/items?site_id=4
?fulltext_search={query}
o:title = {__label__}
dcterms:title.0.@value = dcterms:title
dcterms:date.0.@value = dcterms:date
o:id = dcterms:identifier ^^uri ~ https://dev.omeka.org/omeka-s-sandbox/s/mallhistory/item/{__value__}

[generic:json #geonames] = Geonames generic
http://api.geonames.org/searchJSON
?username=johnsmith&q={query}
geonames = {list}
toponymName = dcterms:title
geonameId = dcterms:identifier ^^uri ~ https://www.geonames.org/{__value__}
adminCodes1.ISO3166_2 = dcterms:identifier ~ ISO 3166-2: {__value__}
countryName = dcterms:isPartOf
~ = dcterms:spatial ~ Coordinates: {lat}/{lng}

[generic:xml #IdRef Person] = IdRef Person
https://www.idref.fr/Sru/Solr
?version=2.2&rows=30&q=persname_t%3A{query}
/doc/str[@name="affcourt_z"] = {__label__}
/response/result/doc = {list}
/doc/arr[@name="affcourt_r"]/str = dcterms:title
/doc/arr[@name="nom_t"] = foaf:lastName
/doc/arr[@name="prenom_t"] = foaf:firstName
/doc/date[@name="datenaissance_dt"] = dcterms:date ^^numeric:timestamp
/doc/str[@name="ppn_z"] = bibo:uri ^^uri ~ https://idref.fr/{__value__}
```
