# Item Sets Tree

Item Sets Tree is a module for [Omeka S](https://omeka.org/s/) which allows to
organize item sets in a tree.

## Installation

See general end user documentation for [Installing a
module](http://omeka.org/s/docs/user-manual/modules/#installing-modules)

## How it works

Once the module is installed, you can define a parent item set when adding or
editing an item set.

You can visualize the whole tree by clicking on the menu entry in the left
sidebar.

The tree is also accessible in public sites. You can add a navigation link to
it in [Sites Â» Navigation](https://omeka.org/s/docs/user-manual/sites/site_navigation/)
